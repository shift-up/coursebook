## Day 1 & Day 2


### Pair back-end project

- Pick a partner

- Pick any React group project that was worked on in week 17. Fork the project

- Think about all the places the app that could use a back-end API. This would likely include all the places the app is using a JSON file to get and update data. In all these places, have the app connect to a local Node.js server. And ofcourse, you'll need to create this server to support the app!

- Make sure to use the correct request types (GET, POST, PUT etc.)

- Since we haven't gotten into databases yet, you can use a JSON file on the back-end to store and retreive data

- Feel free to modify the React app where necessary and to add more features!
