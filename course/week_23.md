## Day 1 & Day 2


### Pair database project

- Pick a partner

- Pick any Node.js pair project that was worked on in week 21. Fork the project

- Think about all the places the app that could use a database. This would likely include all the places the app is using a JSON file to get and update data. In all these places, have the app do the same but via a database instead of a JSON file

- Think about the advantages a database gives over a JSON file. How would you change the app, now that it's powered by feature-packed database? Make these changes!

- Feel free to modify the app where necessary and to add more features!
