## Day 1 & Day 2


### First group project!

- Gather a team of 2-5 learners

- Build a calculator like this one using React: https://ahfarmer.github.io/calculator/

- Here's the source code to the app that you can reference (don't copy it!): https://github.com/ahfarmer/calculator

- Have one team member create a public repository on GitHub and add the other members as collaborators

- To collaborate seamlessly, the team should follow a Git workflow like this one (ignore step 6): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFYyTZwMyAg

- Break down the work and divide the tasks. Think about whether the team would benefit by using a project tracking tool like Trello

- Use this collaboration as an opportunity to pair program, do code reviews and learn from one another
