## Day 1 & Day 2


### Form a group and choose your project!

- Gather a team of 2-5 learners

- Choose a website that you'd like to rebuild, or come up with a new project idea that excites the team!

- Choose a project that enables you to use React, React Router and Redux

- The app that you build should be responsive

- Since we haven't learned how to build server-side APIs as of yet, you can store the data that's needed for the app in a JSON file like so: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C85o8jIgUU. This means that the app would have dummy data for now, but don't worry about that

- Learn more about how to collaborate with Git by completing the 'Collaborating' section at https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing. You'll most definitely end up using this system at a software engineering job!
