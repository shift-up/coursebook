## Day 1 & Day 2


### Challenge

Grab a pair and solve this challenge: https://edabit.com/challenge/TpqLBh6weuqFs9qKy


### Continue working on the group project


### Retro

- Set aside time to have an honest discussion within the team about what went well and what could have been better. Note down the team discussion from this meeting and come up with process improvements for your next group project!


### Extra credit (if you have time)

- For an added challenge, respond to keyboard input too. One shouldn’t need to add an <input> element to make this work. But if you do use an <input>, make it so that the user doesn’t need to focus the input control to type into it.

- Add other functionality and modify the app as you wish!
