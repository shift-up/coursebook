## Day 1 & Day 2


### Continue working on the group project

### Extra credit (if you have time)

- For an added challenge, respond to keyboard input too. One shouldn’t need to add an <input> element to make this work. But if you do use an <input>, make it so that the user doesn’t need to focus the input control to type into it.

- Add other functionality and modify the app as you wish!
